    <div id="Advice" class="col"><h2>Advice for your business</h2>

        <p>
            Whether you are just starting out or have been established for a while, a fresh set of eyes always brings a
            different perspective. It is easy to get stuck into the day to day of managing your business or charity. The
            hard part is extracting yourself to work on how you will grow your organisation or improve the way the
            organisation works. Starting from your vision and mission we help you define what your current state is,
            where you would like to be and what barriers may be standing in the way of your ultimate success. Working
            together we can form a plan that can help you overcome your barriers to meet your immediate and future
            goals.
        </p></div>
    <div id="Training" class="col"><h2>Training and Facilitation</h2>

        <p>
            We take the time to listen to the needs for your business or charity and create customised training sessions
            to help you and your staff upskill. Our trained facilitator has over 10 years of experience in working with
            people of all ages and diverse backgrounds and loves nothing more than creating a safe and constructive
            learning environment. Whether you are looking to upskill in how to use social media or need a refresher in
            how to market your product or services we can tailor the session to your organisation's requirements. We can
            deliver the training on your premises making it easily accessible to you and your staff.
        </p></div>
    <div id="Volunteers" class="col"><h2>Skilled Volunteers</h2>

        <p>
            For community organisations and charities who have already invested in our services we can help you further
            by pairing you with skilled volunteers. Our skilled volunteers have experience and expertise to help you to
            deliver on your strategic goals. The skilled volunteer pairing is a complimentary service for our charity
            partners as we are passionate about helping you succeed in your mission to make a difference.
